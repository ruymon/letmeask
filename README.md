# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Let Me Ask - A Q&A platform 

## About the Project

This project was boiler plated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and developed during Next Level Week. The project is a Web-based application following **SPA Architecture** that is built with React, Typescript and Firebase (for user Auth).

The Interface was built by Rebecca Gonzalez, using Figma. [Check out the Project Design on Figma!](https://www.figma.com/file/u0BQK8rCf2KgzcukdRRCWh/Letmeask/duplicate)



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
